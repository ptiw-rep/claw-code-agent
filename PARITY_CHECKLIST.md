# Parity Checklist Against npm `src`

This document tracks what is already implemented in Python and what is still missing compared with the upstream npm runtime.

This is a functionality-oriented checklist, not a line-by-line source equivalence claim. Large parts of the mirrored Python workspace still act as inventory or scaffolding, while the working Python runtime currently lives mainly in [`src/agent_runtime.py`](src/agent_runtime.py), [`src/query_engine.py`](src/query_engine.py), [`src/agent_tools.py`](src/agent_tools.py), [`src/agent_prompting.py`](src/agent_prompting.py), [`src/agent_context.py`](src/agent_context.py), [`src/agent_manager.py`](src/agent_manager.py), [`src/plugin_runtime.py`](src/plugin_runtime.py), [`src/agent_slash_commands.py`](src/agent_slash_commands.py), and [`src/openai_compat.py`](src/openai_compat.py).
